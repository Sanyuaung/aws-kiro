## Initial User Request
**Timestamp**: 2026-02-06T04:02:14.489Z
**User Input**: "Kiro Dash is an endless runner arcade game in which the player controls a character called Kiro, who automatically runs forward through a vibrant city track. The player's goal is to survive as long as possible by navigating Kiro through an ever-changing path filled with obstacles, barriers, and gaps.

Kiro continuously moves forward at increasing speed. The player can swipe or press directional keys to move left or right between lanes, jump over obstacles, or slide under barriers. Collecting coins and power-ups increases the player's score and grants temporary abilities such as speed boosts, shields, or coin multipliers.

The game ends when Kiro collides with an obstacle or fails to avoid a hazard. The player's final score is based on distance traveled and collectibles gathered.Game Concept: Ghosty Escape

Ghosty Escape is a 2D endless runner–style arcade game in which the player controls a mischievous ghost named Ghosty, who automatically moves to the right through a haunted cityscape.

A relentless Spirit Guard chases Ghosty from behind, forcing the player to maintain momentum and avoid mistakes. Ghosty must navigate a continuous path filled with obstacles, gaps, and barriers by switching lanes, jumping, and sliding.

Controls

A / D – Move Ghosty left or right between three lanes

Space – Jump over obstacles and gaps

Ctrl – Slide under low barriers

Ghosty is constantly affected by gravity and forward motion. The Spirit Guard gradually closes the distance if the player slows down, collides with obstacles, or mistimes jumps or slides.

Scoring & Progression

The player earns points based on distance traveled

Collectible soul orbs increase score and unlock temporary boosts

Successfully avoiding obstacles increases game speed over time

Failure Conditions

Colliding with an obstacle

Falling into a gap

Being caught by the Spirit Guard

The game ends immediately upon failure, displaying the final score and distance traveled."
